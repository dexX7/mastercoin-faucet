  <h3>What is Mastercoin?</h3>
  <span class="description">
    <p>Mastercoin is an open source project driven by the members of the Bitcoin community that want to see more
    advanced features implemented on top of the blockchain.</p>
    <p>Mastercoin enables the Bitcoin eco-system to become more decentralized and operate more in line with its 
    peer to peer nature. History has shown that when a digital service has a single point of failure it will be 
    attacked and taken down. Mastercoin removes many of today's bottle necks, that are preventing the wide spread 
    use of Bitcoin.</p>
